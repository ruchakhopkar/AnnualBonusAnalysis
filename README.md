<b> Challenge: </b>
It's end of the financial year and that means time for annual bonuses!
The store operates in 3 regions and only the top-performing employee in each region qualifies for a bonus.
Find out which 3 employees are eligible to get a bonus for this year.
Employees are measured on total value of sales ($).

1. Connect a .csv file using the 'text file' option while importing the data.
2. The 2 main groups of fields in Tableau: Dimensions(independent variables) and measures(dependent variables)
3. How to add calculated fields in Tableau
